   <p><span>I</span>t is my joy to share with you, the purpose why I created this website. But before that, I want to thank you for visiting our website. I hope that as you explore here, you may find the answer to all of your questions in mind and you may find the reason for why you live. Hoping that this thing will be a blessing in your life. May it give you direction and inspire you every day of your life. Happy browsing.</p>

   <h4 class="center">Our Purpose</h4>
   <p><span> A</span>s a Christian and a person, it is my passion to share all the things that I've learned in my life. By this website, I want to encourage those who are hopeless, those who are living a miserable life, those who live in pain and agony, those whose life is nowhere to go, those people who want to take their life by committing suicide. <b><u>TakeGod.com</u></b> is just a simple website that reminds you that you need to come to God again and let God take over everything.</p>
  
   <h4 class="center">The Matter Most!</h4>
   <p>There is nothing greater than the joy I feel every time I know or hear that something has changed in God’s love. For me, nothing is more important in this world than a person’s life. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter how bad or bad you are, or even if you say you are the worst person in the world, your worth will not change in His sight. God loves me and you too. And you are the most important thing in his heart and mind that anything or anyone, nothing can change. His love for us cannot be changed. So, what are you waiting for? Have God in your heart. Take Him to the very depths of your heart!</p>
